                        <p>Acne is a mysterious skin disorder, but one thing is for sure – it can be controlled with the right combination of products, used in the correct way. Just as in a clogged drain, the pore must be treated with products that unclog it and kill the acne bacteria.</p>

                        <p>Face Reality Skincare has a clear-skin system that will have your acne under control in about three to four months, depending on your type of acne. We combine the power of clinical-grade products that are customized for your type of acne, with a series of bi-monthly treatments. We also teach you about other aggravating factors that make you break out – foods, medications, cosmetics, stress, and common ingredients in skin care formulations that might be clogging your pores (even professional and prescription products)</p>
